# Words that stuck


[On Exploration](https://tidyfirst.substack.com/p/exploring-ai) :
```
  It’s tempting to try to figure out where things are going to go next. Tempting, but futile.
  You can’t figure out the implications of a changed cost structure by thinking hard.
  We’ve all parachuted in the dark onto a large field. There’s large veins of gold down there somewhere.
  There is no metal detector so our best bet is to stick a shovel in the dirt & see what we turn up.

  Nonsense is a resource

  Boredom is Valuable!

[On Work, Efficiency](https://invertedpassion.com/the-anti-productivity-manifesto/) :
```
  The fear of the irrelevancy and losing out in the race impacts universally.
  It does not matter whether you’re on top or in the middle,
  whether you have enough money to retire for the rest of your life,
  or whether you have won awards. The treadmill never stops.

  Often we’re not addicting to a particular kind of work, but the mere behavior of working.

  Perhaps this is what Buddha was hinting. The ultimate liberation from suffering – the enlightenment –
  happens when you’re at peace with and bask at merely existing.

[On Beauty & Motivation](https://world.hey.com/dhh/beautiful-motivations-6fef7c73) :
```
And beauty isn't binary. It's the journey of a thousand little decisions and investments in making
something marginally prettier than it was before. To resist the urge to just make it work,
and not stop until you make it shine. Not for anyone else, even,
although others will undoubtedly appreciate your care.
But for yourself, your own motivation, and your own mission.
```
